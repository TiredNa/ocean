    <strong style="color: rgb(11, 22, 175);">Care Level:</strong><br><p>We have included a general guideline in our
        Quick Stats designating the level of care different aquatic life species
         require. This is provided to give you a basis of the hardiness of the species,
          which you can then match to your level of experience.</p>
   
   <strong style="color: rgb(11, 22, 175);">Easy</strong><br> <p>Although not indestructible, the species in this 
       category have proven to be not too demanding in the care that they require. 
       Most of these species do not have special feeding requirements and can tolerate 
       less than perfect water conditions.</p>
   
   <strong style="color: rgb(11, 22, 175);">Moderate</strong><br><p>The species in this category demand a bit
        more attention than those that are considered "Easy" to care for. Some 
        of these species may have special feeding, lighting, or water movement 
        requirements and may require water conditions closer to those found in
       nature.</p>
   
   <strong style="color: rgb(11, 22, 175);">Difficult</strong><br><p>Species that fall into this category demand a 
       higher level of both attention and water quality. Many of these species have 
       special feeding, water quality, movement and lighting requirements. They should 
       only be added to a mature, well-established aquarium system, especially corals 
       and sensitive invertebrates, as many reef aquariums do not become fully 
       established for many months - sometimes up to a year. These "Difficult" 
       species should be among the last additions to your collection.</p>
   
   <strong style="color: rgb(11, 22, 175);">Expert Only</strong><br><p>
       Organisms in the "Expert Only" category are very difficult to maintain in
        captivity in the long term. The requirements of many of these species are
        specialized, and may need to be kept in a species-specific aquarium. These 
        species are best kept by the most advanced hobbyists and research institutions.
         A mature, well-established aquarium is a must for these species.
